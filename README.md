# Ropes-Log
Excel userform for inputting rope usage from a large challenge course.

On the "key" worksheet, press the "run program" button to initialize the userform. The user can select the element from a combobox, then input the number of uses each rope or cable received in a day. The date and initials fields are required to submit. When a rope is changed in the other sheets, the key worksheet and userform update automatically.
